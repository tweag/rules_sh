    This can be used inside a repository rule run on Windows to generate a shim
    of an external executable and import it into an `sh_binaries` target.

    if cmd != None:
        create_shim(
            repository_ctx,
            name = "cmd",

        )
    ```

      name: string or path, The name of the newly created shim, without the .exe suffix, relative to the repository directory.
      target: string or path, Absolute path to the target executable.
      shim_exe: string; Label; or path, The original shim binary.
